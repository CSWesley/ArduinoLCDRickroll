# Arduino LCD Rickroll

### Note:
This code is for a 16x2 LCD display (LCD1602) with built in resistors. If your LCD module does not have built in resistors, you can add one between 5V and pin 15. Don't destroy your LCD!

In respects to the code, it's not beautiful but I felt like this brute force method would be the most effective.

I can add a pin chart if someone wants. Just make a pull request, email, or DM on Discord.


### Components (that I'm using)

List:
Arduino Mega (This isn't the only LCD compatible Arduino obviously, but the only one I have)

LCD1602 module

Potentiometer (10k)

Breadboard (Mine is 830 tie-points)

M-M jumper wires (x16)
